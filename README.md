# Simple Raytracer

![A Demo Image for the Ray Tracer](./demo.png)

A small simple software ray tracer written in C++, can draw spheres with varying reflectivity and shinyness, with shadows for different light sources. Outputs the image as a .tga file.

Tried to use modern C++ features when possible. Scene information, image size, etc is hardcoded in main.cpp.

## To Build On Linux
Can just run `make` in the root folder and run the resulting binary with `./raytracer`
